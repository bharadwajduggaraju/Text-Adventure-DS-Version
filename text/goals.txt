Each print statement has a line between them when presented in the console (automatically), make sure to make it so that only happens with user input.

Make certain attributes optional, or even better, make configurable by user

Make mistakes by user more user friendly and viable

Make input less text-specific so that more varied inputs are accepted

Make language less code-like

Process user text to make later processing more efficient (such as remove space)

Make adding to key data less static (such as making adding to characters and adding to attacks part of the same code block/function)
