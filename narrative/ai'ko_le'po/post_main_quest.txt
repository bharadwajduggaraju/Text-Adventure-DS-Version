    You enter Ai'ko Le'po, taking note of the curiously decorated people and houses. It's almost as if you're walking through a plume of colors and sounds of all kinds. Kosu stares in wonder, his mouth agape.
    "It's so... much," he says, after sniffing the air. "Wait, wait, I think I see-" Kosu bounds off towards something in the village you don't see.
    You look around, noting a large building with a sign reading, "Town Hall", and another large- if shabbier- building with a sign reading, "Servant's Quarters." A fountain stands at the center of the square, and a dark-skinned woman in a pale yellow dress dances around it.
    You turn to see another dark-haired citizen, though this time an old man, sitting on a chair outside a shop.

    As you walk forward, people begin to speak in hushed voices, excited looks on their faces as the occasional brave person will shout, "our savior!", or, "thank you!".
