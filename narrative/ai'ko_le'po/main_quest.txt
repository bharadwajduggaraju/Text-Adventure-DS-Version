    Kosu grins. "You can't even catch up!"
    He dodges through the trees and swerves out of sight.
    Now regretting your rash decision, you chase after him, stumbling over tree roots and trampling the packed dirt.
    The path turns into a clearing ahead of you, and you dash towards the gap in the trees, hoping that Kosu is okay.
    As you turn the corner, Kosu comes into view. He hasn't moved.
    "What'd you find?" you demand.
    Kosu holds up his hand. "Shhhh..." he whispers. "Look."

    The two of you slowly amble along the path, a slight wedge of discomfort separating you.

    His innocent expression is full of boundless joy.

    A soft buzzing flows out of the silence, steady and rhythmic as the volume climbs.
    Kosu grabs your arm frantically. "Something is really wrong with this place!"
    You drag him towards the entrance to the clearing, but you can no longer find it; in fact, the trees seem to be spinning around you, rotating at an immeasurable speed.
    Only one thing in the clearing remains immobile; a small rock, situated in the dead center.

    The lion's gaping maw beckons, tunneling down into the pitch-black underground.
    Kosu shoves past you. "I'll go first," he yells over the din. Before you can react, he jumps into the hole.
    After one more second of hesitation, you leap after him into the abyss.

    One second passes as you shoot downwards...
    {TIME:1}
    ... then another.

    You hear the wind whistling through your ears, and ever-so-suddenly, your eyes register the ground rushing up to meet you.
    There is no Kosu- only hard, spiky rock.
    {TIME:1}
    You inhale and exhale, terror spiking your adrenaline, and then attempt to grab a stalactite.
    {TIME:1}
    After a brief pause, you start to scream. Agony rings in your ears as you curse your mother, your village, and Kosu for bringing this awful fate upon you.
    {TIME:1}
    A gust of warm air washes over you, and suddenly you feel your body being carried backwards.
    {TIME:1}
    Your light-headedness takes over as you try frantically to hold onto consciousness, but the effort is futile...
    {TIME:1}
    As you shoot over a dark lake, dimly registering the tiny arms that now grip your shirt, you pass out.
    {TIME:1}{CLEAR}
    {LOADING_EFFECT}
    You are lying on a cold rock.
    You shove one arm out frantically, then retract it rapidly as you start sliding forward.
    The surface is as smooth and chilly as ice, yet as black as obsidian. It refuses to give you grip.
    Vision swimming, you struggle to stand up, pushing yourself even farther forward.
    At last, you succeed.
    The cave around you sparkles with tens of thousands of tiny pinpricks of light.
    It's a surreal image to behold, but it produces a considerable strain on your eyes.
    You only have a second to register when you see the dark silhouette that stands in front of you, buzzing with the same odd sound.

    A low rumble echoes through the cave.
    {COLOR:WHITE_ITALIC}
    Esteri... you have not proven your worth...
    {COLOR:WHITE}
    You spin around, scrabbling to direct your rotation.
    Before you can run, though, the walls reform around you. There are two openings in front of you, but they are guarded by a short, dragon-like figure.
    {COLOR:WHITE_ITALIC}
    The Dronae... will test you.

    The short monster- the Dronae- buzzes.

    If you can answer their questions correctly, you shall reach the end of the tunnel with no issue.
    {COLOR:WHITE}
    You stare down the Dronae.
    {COLOR:WHITE_ITALIC}
    But if you answer wrong... you will never be able to make it.

    The wall lights glow brighter, as if to taunt you.

    Oh, and one last warning: I'd suggest that you locate your friend soon- or he may be gone forever.

    A low ringing hums through your ears, then a whistle of air as the voice floats away.

    You stumble into another lighted cavern. This one is lined with fluorescent mushrooms like the ones you saw above. The floor is woven with roots.
    "Esteri!" Kosu's voice rings off the walls.
    Your eyes adjust, and you gasp.
    Your friend is ensnared in a tangle of vines, wrapping around him in an intricate pattern and constricting quickly.
    Yet again, a Dronae stands guard in front of the structure.
