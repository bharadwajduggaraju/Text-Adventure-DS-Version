#Whitespace (' ', '\n', '\t', etc.):
  #All whitespace at the beginning or end of each section (text between colons, semicolons, commas, etc. when used to separate values) is removed. This means that 'COLOR: RESET', for example, will be treated as 'COLOR:RESET'. In the unlikely event of section containing only one whitespace character, however, this will not apply.
  #If you want to include whitespace at the beginning (or end) of a section, see Exclamation Marks.
  #Examples:
    #'CMND:  text  ; ' -> 'CMND:text; '

#Exclamation Marks ('!'):
  #An exclamation mark at the beginning of a section which is then followed by whitespace will be removed, but the whitespace will not. Similarly, an exclamation mark at the end which is preceded by whitespace will be removed, leaving the whitespace.
  #Note that an exclamation mark at the end of a sentence (such as "The battle started!") will not be removed because there is no whitespace immediately before it.
  #Also note that whitespace followed by an exclamation mark followed by more whitespace will be reduced to the last group of whitespace. (See examples)
  #If, for whatever reason, you want an exclamation mark at the beginning followed by whitespace or an exclamation mark at the end preceded by whitespace, double the exclamation mark.
  #Examples:
    #'CMND: !  text!' -> 'CMND:  text!'
    #'CMND: !! text!!' -> 'CMND:! text!'
