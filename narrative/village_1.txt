    The town square is a bustling place, even in overcast weather. Then again, today is market day.
    Still, it feels vaguely like a holiday. The square is decorated with banners, and everyone seems cheerful.
    You turn to Kosu and ask, "Is today a holiday?"
    Kosu shrugs. "I'm not sure. They taught us more about where things are than what people do."
    Still curious, you ask someone selling scarves, "Excuse me, is today a holiday?"
    He smiles. "Not before," he says, "but who knows about the future?" He winks at you before returning to his hawking.

    Kosu says, "I'm going to ask the locals about the surrounding area."
    You tell him, "Okay, don't get into trouble."
    Kosu nods. "Of course! I'll stay in the town square."
    {TIME:0.25}

    You look around slightly uncertainly.
    "Hello!"
    You turn towards the voice. It's the scarf seller from earlier!
    "Excuse me, but where're you from? Your coat looks a little different," he asks.
    Slightly surprised, you answer, "From the mountains."
    "Hm. It looks a bit thick."
    You shurg. "It's very comfortable."
    He nods. "I can see that. But let me know if you want a thinner coat. My name's Balliya, by the way."

    "Hi, Esteri!"
    You wave back. "Hello... Balliya, right?"
    {ENTER:townsquare_squareVisits2_checkCoat}
    You stand there for a few minutes, uncertain how to respond. Then Balliya breaks the silence.
    "Um..." He paused, looking a little embarrassed. "My wife and I have been finding bite marks on her scarves. It looks like rats. Of course, rats bite or dig through anything for some nice Nagara'ne silk.
    "I'd find their nest and kill them, but they live in the forest, and... Well... I'd prefer not to go into the forest."
    {ENTER:townsquare_BalliyaQuest}
    You notice the sun setting and say, "Well, we'd better be going now. Bye!"
    Balliya waves. "Bye!"
